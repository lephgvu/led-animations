### Exercise 5
Integrate the 7SEG-LED to the 4 way traffic light. In this case, the 7SEG-LED is used to display countdown value.
 
In this exercise, only source code is required to present. The function display7SEG in previous exercise can be reused.

### Exercise 3
Extend to the 4-way traffic light. Arrange 12 LEDs in a nice shape to simulate the behaviors of a traffic light. A reference design can be found in the figure bellow.

### Exercise 4
Add only one 7 led segment to the schematic in Exercise 3. This component can be found in Proteus by the keyword 7SEG-COM-ANODE. For this device, the common pin should be connected to the power supply and other pins are supposed to connected to PB0 to PB6. Therefore, to turn-on a segment in this 7SEG, the STM32 pin should be in logic 0 (0V).
 
Implement a function named display7SEG(int num). The input for this function is from 0 to 9 and the outputs are listed as following:
