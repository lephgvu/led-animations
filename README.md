# Led-Animations
Practice Lab 1 of MCP-MCU course

### Exercise1
From the simulation on Proteus, one more LED is connected to pin PA6 of the STM32 (negative pin of the LED is connected to PA6). The component suggested in this exercise is LED-YELLOW, which can be found from the device list.

In this exercise, the status of two LEDs are switched every 2 seconds, as demonstrated in the figure bellow.
